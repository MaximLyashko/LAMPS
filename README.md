##LAMPS Board
LAMPS is the PCB control board that rides on top of an Arduino Mega 2560.  It provides Galvanometer control (Through 12 bit DACs).  It also controls the laser, buttons, Z Stepper Motor (Through Pololu Carrier), End Stops, LEDs, etc...  (It is the Brainz).

##Parts
All of the parts are available as sketchup (skp) and stl files.

##Non-Printer Parts
The parts were all designed to be used with Misumi 2020 rails.

###LAMPS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.
