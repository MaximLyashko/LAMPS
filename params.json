{"name":"sLAMPS: Open High Resolution Stereolithography, For Everyone","tagline":"","body":"LAMPS - The Open Hardware SLA Printer\r\n-------------------------------------\r\nLAMPS (Laser Arduino Mega Pololu Shield|SLA Printer) is an open control board and SLA printer design.  The SLA Printer strives to be a low-cost, small footprint (It is only 200mmx350mm!), highly capable SLA Printer. The build platform size is currently 80mmx80mm, but could probably be increased by someone who is motivated to enhance the design.\r\n\r\n#License\r\nThe entire lamps project (PCB, Source Code, Design Files... EVERYTHING) is licensed under the GPL.\r\n\r\n#LAMPS Board\r\nLAMPS is the PCB control board that rides on top of an Arduino Mega 2560.  It provides Galvanometer control (Through 12 bit DACs).  It also controls the laser, buttons, Z Stepper Motor (Through Pololu Carrier), End Stops, LEDs, etc...  (It is the Brainz).\r\n\r\nVersion 1.0 of the LAMPS board has been manufactured and tested... I found a few issues with the board and am currently redesigning and removing a few unnecessary components for 1.1. Release date T.B.D.\r\n\r\n#Firmware\r\nThe firmware for LAMPS is a fork of Marlin (The best open source RepRap firmware I know of), and can be found here: https://github.com/beardface/Marlin-LAMPS\r\nThe firmware is very much an active work-in-progress, and I encourage you to fork, and contribute.\r\n\r\n#LAMPS Printer Parts -WARNING...
